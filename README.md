# Some backend details

1. Storage directory : On windows jarvis stores user file such as logs , settings , data bases etc in C:\programData\JarvisData. While in ubuntu it stores in /opt/JarvisData.

2. Encryption used in password Data base - Jarvis uses military class encryption technique provided by easySED module to securely store your passwords. you learn more about easySED at https://www.letscodeofficial.com/pySEDDocs
